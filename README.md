# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications by applying principles of engineering and computer science.
IMPORTANCE
Accelarates innovation
Enables production of software products that are reliable , secure and perfom well.






Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
(1)Introduction of high level programming languages (1950-1960)
Fortran and Cobol enabled programmers to write code in human readable format.
(2) The birth of structured programming (1960-1970)
Use of control structures like loops,conditionals and functions were introduced to make debugging and maintaining code easier.
(3) Adoption of object oriented programming
Object oriented programming encouraged reuse,modularity and organization of code.
C++ and Java languages were popularized.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Is the fpoundation of the project as it outlines objectives and roadmap of the project.
Requirement analyis - Developers and stakeholders analyze and document rquirements.
Design - Developers create the system and software design.
Implementation- Developers use programming languages framework and tools to create functional software
Testing- The software is tested to identify and fix bugs.
Deployment- Software is released to users after succesful testing.
Maintenance - Fixing of any post realease issues or updating of new features.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear sequential approach while Agile is iterative incremental approach.
Waterfall is less flexible while Agile is highly flexible.
Waterfall is suitable for projects with clear defined goals and requirements.
Agile is suitable for projects whose requirements and end goals is likely to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer wrtes and tests and develops the code that maintains the software.
Quality assurance engineer verifies software perfomance, security and compatibility.
Project manager defines the project's scope , sets objectives and develops schedules.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE'S 
They offer advanced code editing features.
They have built in debuggers that help developers identify and fix issues quickly.
They provide project navigation tools making it easier to manage codebases.
Examples include visual studio code and PyCharm
VCS
Enables multiple developers to work on different parts of a prject.
They are intergrated with cd pipelines thus enabling automatic testing and deployment as changes are pushed
Support branching enabling experimentationand development of new features without disputing main codebase
examples include Git and SVN



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Balancing speed and quality
They should learn to balance speed while producing high standard results
Debugging amnd problem solving under pressure
This requires high logical thinking , patience and in depth understanding.
Ensuring security and privacy
They can overcome this by writing code that is resilient to vulnerabilities and protects user data
Keeping up with rapid technological change
They should invest in time and dedicate themselves to keep learning.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing focuses on verifying individual components of code.
Intergration testing focuses on evaluating how different modules or units work together.
System testing tests the whole intergrated software system.
Acceptance testing determines whether the software meets user expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting instructions to learning management systems to enable them produce accurate responses
IMPORTANCE
Improves response accuracy and relevance
Reduces ambiguity and misinterpretation
Enhances model perfomance


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague
Describe the charachter Rhanaeyra

improved
Describe the charachter Rhanaeyra, the realms delight and queen of dragonstone in the series House of the dragon.
